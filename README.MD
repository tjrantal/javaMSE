Class to calculate multiscale entropy. Ported from M. Costa's C implementation, visit http://physionet.org/physiotools/mse/ for the original implementation, and further details.

Ported from C to java by Timo Rantalainen 2014 tjrantal at gmail dot com. The C source (not included) written by M Costa 2004 was copied from http://physionet.org/physiotools/mse/
Licensed with the GPL as per Costa's licensing. Implemented calculating MSE for different coarseness levels simultaneously by treading to utilize the multiple cores often found in contemporary PCs.

Use the gradle build script to build. The script will create a .jar file to ./build/libs directory. javaaddpath that jar in your matlab script to use the class.

Alternatively cd to ./src and javac edu/deakin/timo/MultiscaleEntropy.java
javaaddpath the path to MultiscaleEntropy.class to use the class in matlab.

Test sample provided in 
src/matlabTest folder (depends on having compiled the .jar with gradle)

Updated 30.1.2018
Implemented the refined composite multiscale entropy (RCME), and refined multiscale permutation entropy (RMPE) reported by Ihlen  and colleagues (2016) in J Biomech 49(9):1420-1428.
